Build a fully functional, live, and dynamic version of the EcoSphere AI web app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Keep the same modern design, transitions, and structure as before, but make every page interactive and data-driven.

Include the following:

EcoTrack Dashboard

Allow users to input live data for travel, diet, electricity, and water usage.

Calculate the carbon footprint dynamically in real time using JavaScript formulas.

Display results through interactive charts and animated visualizations using Chart.js.

Add a Save My Data button that stores entries in localStorage and in Replit DB for persistence.

Smart Eco Route Finder

Integrate a live interactive map using Leaflet.js or Mapbox.

Let users choose start and end points and calculate the most eco-friendly routes.

Display live distance, estimated CO₂ saved, and an Eco Score that updates dynamically.

Generative Green Designer

Let users describe their budget, lifestyle, and climate preferences.

Use Replit AI or OpenAI API to generate sustainable home layout or eco-product suggestions.

Display generated results dynamically on the page.

Urban Optimization Dashboard

Aggregate anonymous user data from the EcoTrack section in real time.

Show live charts and city-level insights based on saved user data.

Gamification Zone

Calculate Green Points dynamically based on user actions such as saving data or choosing sustainable routes.

Unlock badges like Carbon Saver and Green Hero when thresholds are reached.

Show a live leaderboard that updates in real time using Replit DB.

Login and Signup Page

Build a functional login and signup system using localStorage for session management and Replit DB for storing user credentials securely.

After login, load user-specific data dynamically on the dashboard.

UI Consistency and Design

Apply Home page animations, transitions, and CSS effects across all other pages.

Keep Back to Home buttons consistently styled and aligned.

Use smooth spacing, subtle color gradients, and modern typography for a professional feel.

Ensure the entire website is live, interactive, and dynamic, with no hardcoded zeros or placeholders. Every page should update automatically as users interact with it.
